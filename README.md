# LatexTranslator
This script gets all written text from a latex document, rips the math and commands apart, translates all the separate strings and recomposes the latex file again.
This is in early development. Script needs "decode input.tex output.txt" parameters.

Translation is done using generating a XML file that can be translated manually using [Gaio](http://gaio.xunta.gal/Tradutor/traducir/doc?lang=gl), for example.
Support for Google Translate will eventually come.
